## Overview
My name is Favour, i'm currently learning front-end development and this is my attempt at recreating the Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution.

## My process
First, I made the background. Next, I made the main div, gave it a display of fles with a flex-direction of column, and centralized it on the page using margin. Next, I inserted the image, rezised it, added a border-radius, then I put in the two texts and styled them according to the requirements. I used the Figma file to get some of the spacing and styling as close as possible.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I will need to find a way to make images snap better to the border of the div. I'll probably just go online, search that up and practice it on my own.
